Venturing into the investing industry is now becoming more and more popular especially for those who want to grow their assets and finances. Whether it is a traditional platform or the structured finance product, people need to be aware before starting to invest that this is not an easy step to take. There is a huge probability that you will fail in your chosen investment type. And so, you may want to know what an IB broker or an introducing broker is and he or she can help you with your investment venture.<br />
<br />
Understanding the role of an IB broker is very important. An introducing broker plays the crucial role of placing pending trades in behalf of his client. An introducing broker will figure in your investment transactions. The main role of this is to meet with clients and help them with investment decisions. Behind the scene, the clearing firm always works with him or her.<br />
<br />
The clearing firm performs a wide variety of functions including the maintenance of an orderly and functional trading platform, provision of account statements and reports to clients, connecting with exchanges in order to clear trades, and depositing funds to customer accounts. The introducing brokers and clearing firms need to coordinate and work with one another in order to run a trading firm.<br />
<br />
You need to understand that the role of this is to make the complexities of trading accessible and easy to understand for retail customers. Clearing firms, on the other hand, are tasked with handling the clearing of trades, preparation of account statements, tasks related to compliance, and accounting works. These brokers can then help people who are making their foray into investment easier and less confusing.<br />
<br />
Another way to look at introducing brokers is to think of them as middlemen between retail investors and the exchange market. Introducing brokers perform a diverse array of services from their clients, depending on their needs. These brokers may provide a full suite of services, including technical support for online traders and customer service-related tasks. Most new traders make their decision based solely on the amount of commission each potential IB broker asks for.<br />

However, there are other important factors that need to be considered, including knowledge, experience, and customer service quality. Like most clearing firms, introducing brokers are in it for the money. They earn through commission for brokerage. However, if you establish a good relationship, you do not necessarily have to pay in full in exchange for his services just as long as you both agree on fair terms. <br />
